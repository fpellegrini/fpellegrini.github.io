Hi! I’m a PhD student at the [Charité-Universitätsmedizin](https://www.charite.de) Berlin and at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de). I’m a member of the [Quality in AI](https://braindata.charite.de/en/) group, lead by [Prof. Stefan Haufe](https://www.tu.berlin/vcard/haufe/). Prior to my PhD, I studied psychology at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de) and at [Bilgi Üniversitesi](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/) Istanbul, and neuroscience at the [International Max Planck Research School](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de) in Tübingen.

My work ranges in the field between medicine and computer science. Specifically, I analyse medical data using data science tools. My main interest is the analysis of functional connectivity from electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Functional connectivity reflects linear or non-linear statistical dependencies between different neural time series coming from different brain areas. Some [works](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315008235) suggest that functional connectivity may be related to communication between brain areas. 

The main goal of my PhD project is to validate and compare methods and analysis pipelines for studying functional connectivity. To this end, we build [simulations](https://github.com/fpellegrini/FCsim) to test the reliability of different pipelines. We are also implementing the most promising pipelines into an [open source toolbox](https://github.com/arnodelorme/roiconnect) to make them easily accessible to others. 
The other part of my PhD focuses on functional connectivity analysis in movement disorders, particularly in Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. These disorders are network disorders in which communication between different parts of the brain is disrupted. We work closely together with the medical groups of [Prof. Andrea Kühn](https://neurologie.charite.de/metas/person/person/address_detail/prof_dr_med_andrea_kuehn/) and [Prof. Ioannis Isaias](https://www.ukw.de/neurologie/team/neurologie-detail/name/isaias-ioannis/). Through these collaborations, we are also part of the [Retune CRC project](https://sfb-retune.de). 

I work to improve life in science by engaging in the Equal Opportunity Committee of the [Retune](https://sfb-retune.de) Project. Outside of research, I play the cello and sing in a choir. I also enjoy gardening and the outdoors. Since I think that it is important to support our democracy, I recently joined a German democratic party and go to demonstrations regularly. I try to keep my carbon footprint small, e.g. by [flying less](https://flyingless.de/en/).
